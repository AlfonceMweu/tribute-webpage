CODE DOCUMENTATION.

1.bioData.php 
This code connects to a database, retrieves all records from the bio_data table, and outputs the data as a JSON-encoded string. If the query fails, it outputs an error message.

2.composer.json
This file specifies the dependencies required for the PHP project. In this case, it specifies supabase.

3.composer.lock
The composer.lock file locks the dependencies to specific versions to ensure consistency across installations.Dependencies are external libraries or packages that the project requires to function properly.To lock in the dependencies means that the exact versions of each dependency are recorded.This ensures that every time the project is installed or updated,the same versions of the dependencies are used, providing consistency across different environments and avoiding potential issues caused by version differences. Examples of dependencies used here are:bayfrontmedia/php-mime-type- a library to detect the appropriate MIME type of a file based on its extension,graham-campbell/result-type-library for implementing the Result type and guzzlehttp/guzzle-PHP HTTP client library.etc

4.config.php
This is a php script that connects to a PostgreSQL database and fetch all records from the bio_data table, outputting the result in JSON format.PostgreSQL is used here solely because it supports SQL and JSON querying. The commented-out code is an alternative method for connecting and querying data using Supabase. Supabase is a backend-as-a-service platform that provides a range of tools to help developers build applications faster.

5.databaseSearch.php

DESIGN CHOICES
Color choices-the color pallette is inspired by the scientific theme,using  different shades of blue and white to reflect clarity and knowleddge.

Typography-a readble font family was used to enhance accessibility and visibility.

Design and layout- the page is designed to celebrate icons in the technology field showcasing biographiesa and images.The who are we,why us nad view more sections help the users navigate and understand the offerings of the site.The emphasis of data validity and use of clear images enhances user engagement.

CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS
The most challenging part like any other webpage was creating a responsive and compatible layout that can work on different types of devices.We overcame this by using CSS media queries and ensuring all elements were up to scale.

Another challenge was obtaining a high qauality API to fetch information from the internet,this is yhey expensive to acquire and there was lack of funds we overcame this by getting a free one but with lower capabilities.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
A high quality API that can fetch more information of an individual from the internet.

More multimedia elements including video clips of interviews and documentaries.
