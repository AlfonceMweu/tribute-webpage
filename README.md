PROJECT DOCUMENTATION.

CODE DOCUMENTATION.
1.bioData.php 
This code connects to a database, retrieves all records from the bio_data table, and outputs the data as a JSON-encoded string. If the query fails, it outputs an error message.
2.composer.json
The composer.json file in your repository specifies the dependencies required for your PHP project. In this case, it specifies a single dependency:

"supabase/supabase-php": "^0.0.1": This indicates that your project requires the supabase-php library, and any version compatible with 0.0.1 will be accepted.
This file is essential for managing PHP project dependencies using Composer, which is a dependency manager for PHP.
